  description: "## TMF API Reference : TMF 641 - Service Ordering Management\n\n##\
    \ Pre-Release : 18.0 - March 2018\n\nThe Service Order API provides a standardized\
    \ mechanism for managing Service Order, a type of order which can be used to place\
    \ an order between a customer and a service provider or between a service provider\
    \ and a partner and vice versa.\n\n### Service Order resource\nA service order\
    \ will describe a list of service order items.  A service order item references\
    \ an action on an existing  or  future  service.  By  service  we  designed  Customer\
    \ Facing  Service  (CFS)  as  well  as  Resource Facing Service (RFS).\nFrom a\
    \ component perspective, a service order should be available\n- from a Service\
    \ Orchestration Component (and it could mix CFS and RFS)\n- from an Infrastructure\
    \ Control & Management component (and it would have only RFS)\n\n### Service Order\
    \ API performs the following operations on service order :\n- Retrieval of a service\
    \ order or a collection of service orders depending on filter criteria\n- Partial\
    \ update of a service order (including updating rules)\n- Creation of a service\
    \ order (including default values and creation rules)\n- Deletion of service order\
    \ (for administration purposes)\n- Notification of events on Service order\n\n\
